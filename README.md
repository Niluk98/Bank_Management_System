Used mysql JDBC driver library to connect the library : JDBC drivers are Java library files with the extension .jar used by all Java applications to connect to the database. Usually, they are provided by the same company which implemented the MySql software. DbSchema Tool already includes an MySql driver, which is automatically downloaded when you connect to MySql.

rs2xml.jar library to fetch the data from database

# MySQL
MySQL is a database management system that is used to maintain relational databases. It is an open-source software backed by Oracle Corporation. This was originally founded by a Swedish company called MYSQL AB which was later acquired by sun microsystems and finally is with Oracle Corporation. As it is an open-source database system, the source code can be modified according to our needs. It also offers premium services if a commercial license is purchased from Oracle Corporation. MySQL is a scalable, fast, and reliable database management system which can run on any platform like Windows, Unix, Linux, etc., and can be installed on the desktop or any server machine.

#JAVA SWING and AWT
AWT and Swing are used to develop window-based applications in Java. Awt is an abstract window toolkit that provides various component classes like Label, Button, TextField, etc., to show window components on the screen. All these classes are part of the Java.awt package.

On the other hand, Swing is the part of JFC (Java Foundation Classes) built on the top of AWT and written entirely in Java . The javax.swing API provides all the component classes like JButton, JTextField, JCheckbox, JMenu, etc.

The components of Swing are platform-independent, i.e., swing doesn't depend on the operating system to show the components. Also, the Swing's components are lightweight.
