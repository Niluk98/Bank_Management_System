# Bank_Management_System
Built a Bank Management System GUI application to help the admin store various data such as new Customer bank account details like account number,pin,transaction history like deposit and withdrawls. -Added functionality for user to create new bank account,withdraw/deposit money through a complete ATM look-a-like GUI. -Used mysql database to store/fetch data entered into the GUI.

Used mysql JDBC driver library to connect the library : JDBC drivers are Java library files with the extension .jar used by all Java applications to connect to the database. Usually, they are provided by the same company which implemented the MySql software. DbSchema Tool already includes an MySql driver, which is automatically downloaded when you connect to MySql.

rs2xml.jar library to fetch the data from database
